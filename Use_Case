Augmented Reality using OpenCV
Challenge: Create an augmented reality application that brings the digital world into the real one by
accurately overlaying 3D models onto real objects, enhancing the userâ€™s interaction with their
surroundings.
Participants Will:
Capture Real-Time Video:
o Use OpenCV to capture live video feed from a camera (e.g., webcam or smartphone).
o Process each video frame to detect key features and objects in the real world.
Apply Homography for Object Tracking:
o Use Homography to map the 2D coordinates of a real-world object to a 3D space.
o This will allow virtual objects to be placed correctly relative to the detected object in the
camera feed.
Implement Perspective Transformations:
o Use perspective transformations to ensure that the virtual object aligns with the real-world
scene, adjusting for camera angles and positions.
o Ensure the 3D model appears as though it is physically present in the real-world
environment.
Render 3D Objects:

o Learn how to render and overlay 3D models (e.g., a cube, car, or any custom object) onto
the real-world environment.
o Use libraries like OpenGL or GLUT for 3D rendering and OpenCV for combining the 3D model
with the camera feed.
Real-Time AR Experience:
o Process video frames and render the 3D model in real-time, ensuring smooth and realistic
AR interaction.
o Optimize the system for performance, minimizing lag and ensuring responsiveness.
